# OpenTalon Book — Claude Code Constitution

> **What this file is:** This is loaded automatically at the start of every Claude Code session.
> It tells Claude Code everything it needs to know to write this book consistently,
> correctly, and without needing to be re-explained. Every rule here exists for a reason.
> Read the inline comments to understand why.

## 1. Project Identity

This project has two intertwined purposes that must never be confused:

**Purpose A — The Book:**
Title: *OpenTalon: Building an Agentic Coding Assistant with Claude Code*
Subtitle: *A First-Principles Guide to Agentic Software Engineering for Solo Developers*
Author: [Your name here]
Status: In active writing. Check `/book/progress.md` before every session.

**Purpose B — The Software:**
OpenTalon is a real, working macOS CLI agent + web platform being built
*inside* the book. It is not pseudocode. It is not illustrative. It compiles,
runs, and ships. Every code example in the book must work.

**The meta-principle:** The book teaches agentic engineering by doing it.
We use Claude Code to write a book about using Claude Code to build a coding agent.
This is not a coincidence — it is the argument.

> **Why this structure?** Sections are individual files, not chapters.

> loading the entire book. Context is finite. Load only what you need.

## 3. Mandatory Pre-Writing Checklist

**Before writing ANY section, Claude Code MUST:**

1. Read `/book/progress.md` — know what has been written
2. Read the target section's entry in `/book/outline.md` — know what this section must cover
3. Read the immediately preceding section (if it exists) — match the ending
4. Read `/book/opentaion-state.md` — know the current state of the OpenTalon codebase
5. Read `/book/style-guide.md` (if this is your first section this session)
6. Check: does this section introduce code? If yes, verify the code actually runs before writing prose around it

> **Why this checklist?** Claude Code has no memory between sessions.
> Without this checklist, it will contradict earlier sections, reference
> files that don't exist yet, or write code that conflicts with the actual
> codebase. The checklist is the substitute for human memory.

## 4. The OpenTalon Tech Stack

These are fixed. Do not suggest alternatives. Do not use other libraries without
explicit approval. Consistency across all 21 chapters depends on this.

**CLI (macOS terminal agent):**
- Language: Python 3.12+
- CLI framework: Click 8.x
- Terminal UI: Rich 13.x
- HTTP client: httpx (async)
- Config: python-dotenv
- Package manager: uv (not pip, not poetry)
- Distribution: Homebrew tap

**Web Platform (user registration + dashboard):**
- Runtime: Node.js (required — also needed for BMAD in Chapter 13)
- Framework: Vite 5.x (React 18, TypeScript)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS 3.x (raw utility classes, no component library)
- Charts: Recharts (for the usage dashboard bar chart)
- Routing: none — two views (unauthenticated / authenticated) use conditional rendering on Supabase auth state; a router would add packages and complexity for zero benefit
- No shadcn/ui — setup requires interactive CLI, tsconfig path alias changes, and per-component installs; Tailwind utilities are sufficient for a dashboard of this scope

**API (usage proxy + auth backend):**
- Framework: FastAPI 0.110+
- ORM: SQLAlchemy 2.x (async)
- Migrations: Alembic
- Auth: Supabase Auth (magic links, no passwords)
- API key hashing: bcrypt

**Database + Infrastructure:**
- Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- File storage: Supabase Storage
- Deployment: Railway (API) + Vercel (Web)
- LLM provider: OpenRouter (free tier available, no credit card for base models)
- Environment: python-dotenv + Railway env vars

> **Why OpenRouter?** It aggregates open-source models (Llama 3.3,
> DeepSeek R1, Mistral 7B, Qwen 2.5) behind a single API key.
> Many models are free. Readers do not need a credit card to follow along.
> This is non-negotiable — the book is for solo developers with limited budgets.

## 5. Voice and Tone

The author is a **senior agentic engineer at Anthropic** writing for a
**solo developer** who is technically competent but new to agentic systems.

**Write like this:**
- Direct and confident — no hedging ("you might want to consider...")
- Concrete — every claim has an example within two paragraphs
- Respectful of the reader's intelligence — explain *why*, not just *what*
- Occasionally dry and self-aware — this is a technical book, not a textbook
- First person plural where appropriate ("we'll build", "let's examine") — 
  author and reader are collaborating on OpenTalon together

**Never write like this:**
- Marketing language ("powerful", "seamless", "revolutionary")
- Passive voice as a default
- Padding ("It is worth noting that...", "As we can see...")
- Unexplained jargon on first use
- Condescension ("simply", "just", "obviously", "of course")

> **Why these rules?** Voice drift is the invisible enemy of long books.
> By section 15.2, the author sounds like a different person than section 1.1.
> These rules enforce a consistent register across months of writing sessions.

## 6. Section Structure Template

Every section follows this exact structure. Do not deviate.

```
## Section X.Y: [Title]

[OPENING — 1-2 paragraphs]
State the problem or question this section answers.
Connect to the previous section in ONE sentence.
No lists. No code. Just the problem.

[CONCEPT — 2-4 paragraphs]
Explain the idea from first principles.
Use an analogy if the concept is abstract.
Keep paragraphs under 6 sentences.

[THE OPENTAION CONNECTION — 1 paragraph]
Explicitly connect the concept to what we're building.
Example: "In OpenTalon, this means..."
This section must appear in EVERY non-prologue section.

[CODE / EXAMPLE]
If this section has a milestone, show the actual code.
Use the code block format below.
Always show the file path. Always show context (surrounding lines).
Always show the command to run/test it.

[WHAT JUST HAPPENED — 1-2 paragraphs]
Explain what the code does and why it was written that way.
Refer back to the concept. Close the loop.

[CLOSING — 1 paragraph]
Signal what comes next. Do not summarize what just happened.
Example: "Now that the agent loop exists, it needs something to loop over."
```

> **Why this template?** Project-based learning books fail when readers
> lose track of *why* they're building what they're building. The
> "OpenTalon Connection" paragraph forces every concept to earn its place.
> The template also means Claude Code can verify a section is complete
> before moving to the next one.

---

## 7. Code Example Standards

All code in this book must meet these standards:

**File path header** — always show where this code lives:
```
# cli/core/agent.py
```

**Context lines** — show 3-5 lines before and after the relevant change:
```python
# ... existing imports above ...
import httpx
from rich.console import Console

# NEW: async agent loop
async def run(prompt: str, config: Config) -> None:
    console = Console()
    # ...
```

**Run command** — always show how to execute:
```bash
cd opentaion/cli
uv run python -m opentaion "fix the type errors in auth.py"
```

**Expected output** — always show what success looks like:
```
✓ OpenTalon v0.1.0 | Model: deepseek/deepseek-r1 | Context: 12,440 tokens
> Analyzing auth.py...
```

> **Why this standard?** Readers get stuck when they can't reproduce
> the example. Showing context prevents "where does this go?" confusion.
> Showing expected output lets them verify success. Both are basic
> respect for the reader's time.

## 8. What Claude Code Must Never Do

- **Never invent code that has not been built yet.** If a milestone has
  not been reached, reference it as future work. Do not write speculative
  code as if it works.

- **Never write a section that contradicts a previous section.** If
  there is a contradiction in the outline, stop and flag it. Do not resolve
  it silently.

- **Never use a library not in the tech stack** without a visible note
  explaining the deviation and getting implicit approval through the writing.

- **Never skip the pre-writing checklist.** Context coherence is everything.
  A section written without reading the preceding section is a section
  that will need to be rewritten.

- **Never write the entire chapter at once.** The unit of work is the
  section. Write one section, verify it, stop. The human decides what comes next.

- **Never write marketing language about Claude Code or Anthropic.**
  This book is by a practitioner, not a promoter. Be honest about
  limitations, costs, and failure modes.

## 9. Progress Tracking Protocol

After writing each section, Claude Code must:

1. Update `/book/progress.md` — mark the section complete with date
2. Update `/book/opentaion-state.md` if the section introduced new code
3. If the section ended with a working milestone, note the exact state
   of the OpenTalon codebase at that point

> **Why?** This is the "golden set" principle from the book itself.
> Progress.md is the regression test for the book's coherence.
> If you can't describe what was built in each section,
> the next session starts blind.

---

## 10. The One Rule

> The book serves the reader. The system serves the book.
> If any rule in this file creates friction that harms the reader's
> experience, the rule should be changed — not circumvented.
> Raise the issue explicitly rather than working around it silently.

This principle applies to every hook, skill, and configuration in this project.
It is also the conclusion of Chapter 21. We live it before we teach it.
